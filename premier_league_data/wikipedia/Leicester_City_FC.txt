================================================================================

Leicester City Football Club is a professional football club based in the city of Leicester, East Midlands, England. The club currently compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.
The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C, before they became known as Leicester City in 1919, coinciding with the city of Leicester gaining official city status. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894, and moved to the nearby King Power Stadium in 2002 (formerly known as the Walkers Stadium). 
Leicester City have won seven prominent trophies within the English football league system, including one Premier League, one FA Cup, three League Cups, and two FA Community Shields. They are currently the sixth most successful team in English football since the turn of the century, as one of only five clubs to have won all three major domestic trophies since 2000. The club's 2015–16 Premier League title win attracted global attention, and they became one of seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Prior to 2015–16, Leicester's highest league finish was second place in the 1928–29 First Division. 
The club's longest period of time spent at the top level of English football came between 1957 and 1969. During these years, Leicester reached three FA Cup finals, competed in European football for the first time, and recorded their third highest ever league finish. The club have since participated in a further six European campaigns and two FA Cup finals, reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals in 2016–17, winning the FA Cup in 2021, and reaching the UEFA Europa Conference League semi-finals in 2021–22. Leicester won the League Cup in 1964, 1997, and 2000 respectively, and were finalists in 1964–65 and 1998–99.

History
Founding and early years (1884–1949)
Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of Wyggeston School as "Leicester Fosse", the club joined The Football Association (FA) in 1890. Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five grounds, including Victoria Park south-east of the city centre and the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground. The club also joined the Midland League in 1891, and were elected to Division Two of the Football League in 1894 after finishing second. Leicester's first Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at Grimsby Town, with a first League win the following week, against Rotherham United at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the team's largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an FA Cup qualifying game. In 1907–08 the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining promotion to the First Division, the highest level of English football. However, the club was relegated after a single season which included the team's record defeat, a 12–0 loss against Nottingham Forest.
In 1919, when league football resumed after World War I, Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties. The club was reformed as "Leicester City Football Club", particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer Arthur Chandler in the side, they won the Division Two title in 1924–25 and recorded their second-highest league finish in 1928–29 as runners-up by a single point to The Wednesday. However, the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in 1934–35 and, after promotion in 1936–37, another relegation in 1938–39 would see them finish the decade in Division Two.

Post-World War II (1949–2000)
Leicester reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1949, losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club's most prolific ever strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the following season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One for 12 years until 1969, their longest period to date in the top division of English football. Halliday left the club in October 1958.
Under the management of Matt Gillies, who was appointed on 8 November 1958, and his assistant Bert Johnson, Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both 1961 and 1963. As they lost to double winners Tottenham Hotspur in 1961, they were England's representatives in the 1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup. In the 1962–63 season, the club led the First Division during the winter. Thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches, the team became nicknamed the "Ice Kings" and eventually finished fourth, the club's best post-war finish. Gillies guided Leicester to their first piece of silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat Stoke City 4–3 on aggregate to win the League Cup for the first time. Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year but lost 3–2 on aggregate to Chelsea. Gillies and Johnson received praise for their version of the "whirl" and the "switch" system, a system that had previously been used by the Austrian and Hungarian national teams. After a bad start to the season, Matt Gillies resigned in November 1968. His successor Frank O'Farrell was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in 1969, losing to Manchester City 1–0.

In 1971, Leicester were promoted back to the First Division, and won the Charity Shield for the first time. Due to double winners Arsenal's commitments in European competition, Second Division winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners-up Liverpool, beating them 1–0 thanks to a goal by Steve Whitworth. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1973–74.
Frank McLintock, a noted player for seven years for Leicester in a successful period from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, succeeded Bloomfield in 1977. On 19 March 1977, Winston White became Leicester's first black player in an away game at Stoke City. The club was relegated at the end of that season and McLintock resigned. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Second Division championship in 1980. Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in the First Division, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first-team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division, but was sold to Everton in 1985; two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner Alan Smith, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.
Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by David Pleat, who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the Third Division. Gordon Lee was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the Football League.
Brian Little took over in 1991 and by the end of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new Premier League, but lost to Blackburn Rovers by way of a penalty from former Leicester striker Mike Newell. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 4–3 to Swindon Town, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94, Leicester were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second-from-bottom in the 1994–95 season.
McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995, while Leicester were top of the First Division, to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers. McGhee was replaced by Martin O'Neill. Under O'Neill, Leicester qualified for the 1996 Football League play-offs and beat Crystal Palace 2–1 in the final through a 120th-minute Steve Claridge goal to gain promotion to the Premier League. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premier League with four successive top ten finishes. O'Neill ended Leicester's 33-year wait for a major trophy, winning the League Cup twice, in 1997 and 2000, and Leicester were runners-up in 1999. Thus, the club qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1997–98 and 2000–01, the club's first European competition since 1961. In June 2000, O'Neill left Leicester City to take over as manager of Celtic.

Decline in the early 21st century (2000–2008)
Martin O'Neill was replaced by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup. Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late-season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.
Taylor was sacked after a poor start to the 2001–02 season, and his successor Dave Bassett lasted just six months before being succeeded by his assistant Micky Adams, the change of management being announced just before relegation was confirmed. Leicester won just five league matches all season.

Leicester moved into the new 32,314-seat Walkers Stadium at the start of the 2002–03 season, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. Walkers, the Leicester-based crisp manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period. In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower-than-expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the cost of the new stadium. Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled Championship, previously known as Division One.
When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004, Craig Levein was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get The Foxes anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager Rob Kelly took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.
In October 2006, ex-Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandarić was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around £6 million, with the current playing squad valued at roughly £4.2 million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007. On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and Nigel Worthington appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007, the club announced former Milton Keynes Dons manager Martin Allen as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allen's relationship with Mandarić became tense and after only four matches, Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandarić announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megson's "wealth of experience" as a deciding factor in the appointment. However, Megson left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by Bolton Wanderers. Mandarić placed Frank Burrows and Gerry Taggart in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed.

On 22 November, Ian Holloway was appointed manager, and he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league match in charge, beating Bristol City 2–0. However, this success did not last, and Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2007–08 season. Holloway left by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by Nigel Pearson.

Rise back to Premier League and change of ownership (2008–2015)
The 2008–09 campaign was Leicester's first season outside the top two levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions – one of the fastest ever rises to the top of the English football league system. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.
In August 2010, after securing a three-year shirt sponsorship agreement with the Thai duty-free retailer King Power, Mandarić sold the club to Asian Football Investments (AFI), a Thai-led consortium headed by King Power owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his son, Aiyawatt. Mandarić, who remained an investor in AFI, continued to serve as the club's chairman.
On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win from their first nine league matches, Paulo Sousa was sacked with immediate effect. Two days later, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had been approached by the club after a 6–1 defeat to bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract.
On 10 February 2011, Vichai, representing the Thai-based Asian Football Investments consortium, was appointed chairman of the club following Mandarić’s departure in November to take over Sheffield Wednesday.
Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead The Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Manuel Almunia made a double save from an Anthony Knockaert late penalty and Troy Deeney scored at the other end following a swift counterattack.
In 2014, Leicester's march up the league system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, combined with losses by Queens Park Rangers and Derby County, allowed Leicester City to clinch promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at Bolton Wanderers saw Leicester become champions of the 2013–14 Championship, which was a joint-record 7th second-tier title.
Leicester started their first season in the Premier League since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league matches, starting with a 2–2 draw on the opening day against Everton. The Foxes then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2004, with a 1–0 win at Stoke City. On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history, overcoming Manchester United 5–3 at King Power Stadium. They made Premier League history by becoming the first team to beat Manchester United from a two-goal deficit since the league's launch in 1992.
During the 2014–15 season, a dismal run of form saw the team slip to the bottom of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant The Foxes finished the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers, and Leicester's upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up. On 30 June 2015, Nigel Pearson was sacked, with the club stating "the working relationship is no longer viable." The sacking was linked to a number of public relations issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son James' role in a "racist sex tape" made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour. 
On 13 July 2015, the club appointed Claudio Ranieri as their new manager ahead of the 2015–16 Premier League season. Despite an initially sceptical reaction to Ranieri's appointment, Leicester made an exceptional start to the season. Striker Jamie Vardy scored 13 goals over 11 consecutive matches from August to November, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy's Premier League record of scoring in 10 consecutive matches. On 19 December, Leicester defeated Everton 3–2 at Goodison Park to top the Premier League on Christmas Day, having been bottom exactly 12 months earlier.

The club's most successful era (2016–2021)
The club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history on 10 April 2016, as a result of a 2–0 away win at Sunderland and Tottenham Hotspur's 3–0 win over Manchester United. The 2016–17 Champions League campaign would also be the club's first season competing in European football for 15 years. 
On 2 May 2016, Leicester City won the Premier League, after Chelsea came from two goals down to draw 2–2 with Tottenham Hotspur at the "Battle of Stamford Bridge". Bookmakers thought Leicester's title win was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it at the start of the season, which subsequently resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25 million. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title success as the greatest sporting shock ever; multiple bookmakers including Ladbrokes and William Hill had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. One book was titled "The Unbelievables", a spin-off harking back to Arsenal's undefeated team "The Invincibles". The scale of the surprise title victory attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. The Economist declared it would be "pored over for management lessons." Several commentators viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming expectations.
Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, "incredible pace in the areas it is most essential" and defensive solidarity. Former boss Nigel Pearson was credited by pundits and fans as having laid the foundations for Leicester's title-winning season. Reacting to the title win, executive chairman of the Premier League Richard Scudamore said:

"If this was a once in every 5,000-year event, then we've effectively got another 5,000 years of hope ahead of us."
Leicester, while performing well in the UEFA Champions League, struggled domestically during 2016–17, spending much of the first few months in the bottom half of the Premier League table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded coach of the year and Leicester team of the year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was dismissed due to the club's continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. The sacking was met with significant upset and anger from sections of the media, with Gary Lineker calling the sacking "very sad" and "inexplicable", while Manchester United manager José Mourinho blamed it on "selfish players". Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri's sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media, but these were never proven. Craig Shakespeare took over as caretaker manager, and in his first match in charge, Leicester won 3–1 against 5th placed Liverpool. In his second match as caretaker, Shakespeare led Leicester to another 3–1 victory over Hull City. Following those two results, it was decided on 12 March 2017 that Shakespeare would become manager until the end of the season.
Leicester were placed in Group G of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, alongside Porto, Copenhagen and Club Brugge. In their inaugural Champions League campaign, they went undefeated in their first five matches to progress to the knockout stages as group winners. Leicester then faced La Liga club Sevilla in the round of 16 and were defeated 2–1 in the first leg at the Vicente Calderon Stadium. In the second leg at King Power Stadium, Leicester won 2–0 on the night, and 3–2 on aggregate, to advance to the quarter-finals. They then faced Atlético Madrid, and drew 1–1 in the second leg, but lost 2–1 on aggregate after losing 1–0 in the first leg. This put an end to Leicester's first European campaign in 15 years, and they exited the competition as quarter-finalists. Leicester did however, maintain an unbeaten home record throughout their 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign.
Craig Shakespeare, having impressed during his caretaker spell, was appointed full-time on a three-year contract. However, following a poor start to the season he was sacked in October 2017 after four months officially in charge, with Leicester in 18th place in the table. He was replaced by Claude Puel on 25 October 2017. By Christmas, Leicester were in 8th place in the Premier League and finished 9th at the end of the season.
On 27 October 2018, following a home match against West Ham United, a Leonardo AW169 helicopter carrying chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others malfunctioned and crashed outside the club's stadium. This happened shortly after take off from the pitch, and all five people on board the helicopter died. One year later, The Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden opened on 27 October 2019, before The Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Statue was unveiled on 4 April 2022, which would have been Srivaddhanaprabha's 64th birthday.

During the early months of 2019, Leicester went on a seven match winless run, which included four successive home defeats. Following a 1–4 home defeat to Crystal Palace, manager Claude Puel was sacked on 24 February 2019 with the club in 12th place. Former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was appointed as his replacement, and the club finished the season again in 9th place.
The 2019–20 season started with the team picking up 38 points from their first 16 matches, which included a record eight-game winning streak from 19 October to 8 December. On 25 October 2019, Leicester recorded a 0–9 away win at Southampton, the joint-largest win in Premier League history and the largest away win in English top-flight history. In the same season, the club reached the semi-final stage of the League Cup but lost out to Aston Villa over two legs. Despite being in the top four for most of the season, Leicester suffered a drop-off in form at the end of the season, winning only two of their nine games following the resumption of league play due to the coronavirus pandemic. Three defeats in their last four matches saw them slide into 5th place, the second-highest Premier League finish in their history, securing a place in the UEFA Europa League for the following season.
The club's finances were heavily impacted by the COVID pandemic, with the parent company King Power International Group being in the travel retail sector. Despite this, the club spent £57 million on transfer fees in the summer of 2020, which came in at a net spend of £10 million, with £46 million generated from player sales. After finishing 5th again in the 2020–21 Premier League, Leicester qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the second consecutive year. On 15 May 2021, Leicester City won the FA Cup for the first time, having lost four previous finals in 1949, 1961, 1963 and 1969, securing a second major trophy in the space of five years. Youri Tielemans scored the only goal against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. The club subsequently became the sixth most successful team in English football since the turn of the century, as one of only five clubs to have won all three major domestic trophies since 2000.

Post success and downfall (2021–present)
In the 2021 summer transfer window, Leicester again spent more than £50 million on new signings, but did not sell any key players for high profit, which went against the club's model from previous years. The summer of 2021 dramatically increased Leicester's wages-to-turnover ratio, and the club failed to qualify for European football in the Premier League season which followed (2021–22), finishing in 8th place. On 7 August 2021, Leicester won the FA Community Shield for the second time in their history. In their 2021–22 UEFA Europa League campaign, Leicester came third in their group and were transferred to the newly established UEFA Europa Conference League. They went on to reach their first European semi-final, losing out to eventual winners AS Roma over two legs. Leicester's spending during the 2022 summer transfer window was heavily restricted, amid concerns over breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. At the same time however, the club were reportedly prioritising investment in infrastructure, to better compete with the Premier League's 'big six' in the long term.
Brendan Rodgers left the club on 2 April 2023, after four years in charge, with ten games remaining and the team in the relegation zone. Dean Smith was appointed as his replacement until the end of the season. On 28 May 2023, despite a 2–1 home win over West Ham United, Leicester City were relegated as a consequence of Everton's 1–0 home victory over AFC Bournemouth. They went down with the highest ever squad value and wage bill outside of the Premier League's traditional 'Big-Six' clubs, and the 2022–23 season ended the club's nine-year stint in the Premier League. This made Leicester only the second former Premier League champions to be relegated from the league since it began in 1992–93, following Blackburn Rovers in 1998–99. 

On 16 June 2023, Enzo Maresca was appointed as the club's new manager ahead of the 2023–24 EFL Championship season. Leicester went on to make their best start to a league season, and the best start since the league became known as the Championship in 2004–05. They went on to gain promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. This was also Leicester's eighth second-tier title which is currently a record for the division. 
In March 2024, the club were referred to an independent commission by the Premier League over an alleged breach of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) for the 2022–23 season. On 3 September 2024, Leicester's appeal against the charges relating to the 2022–23 financial year was successful. On 3 June 2024, Enzo Maresca left the club to join Chelsea ahead of the 2024–25 Premier League season. Leicester appointed Steve Cooper as his replacement on 20 June 2024, but Cooper was sacked after five months in charge on 25 November 2024. Five days later on 29 November 2024, Ruud van Nistelrooy was named as Leicester's new manager.
On 20 April 2025, the club was relegated from the Premier League for the second time in three years, with five matches remaining in the season. On 20 May 2025, Leicester were charged by the Premier League with three separate breaches of the English Football League's financial rules for the 2023–24 season, while the club was competing in the Championship. This followed an earlier suspected breach of Profit and Sustainability Rules relating to the 2022–23 season, while the club was competing in the Premier League. On 27 June 2025, the club came to a mutual agreement with Ruud van Nistelrooy to terminate his contract with immediate effect. On 15 July 2025, the club appointed Martí Cifuentes as manager on a three-year contract.
On 2 October 2025, it was announced that Chief Executive Officer Susan Whelan had stepped down from her role at the club after 15 years, following "a mutual decision" with chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha.

Club identity
The club's traditional home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts and either white or blue socks have been used for the team's kits throughout most of their history. Since the 2015–16 season, the club has played in an all-blue strip with the exception of the 2019–20 and 2021–22 seasons, where they reverted back to wearing white shorts. In 1948, an image of a fox was first incorporated into the club's crest. Since 1992, the club's badge has featured a fox's head overlaid onto a cinquefoil similar to the one used on the coat of arms of Leicester.

The club's stadium move in 2002 prompted some changes to the crest, and the updated design was incorporated into the new stadium, with the emblem used as the main feature on the outside of the West Stand's glass frontage. The design of the club's badge has since evolved further, and the current crest has been in use since 2010. For the 2009–10 season, the club's 125th anniversary year, a special edition badge was worn on the home and away kits. For this season's away kit, there was also a return to the first colours worn by the club (originally Leicester Fosse), albeit with black shorts as opposed to the original white. This kit returned once again for the 2023–24 season, having also featured during the 2004–05 season.
In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the "Post Horn Galop" at home matches, to signal both teams entering the pitch. To the present day, the tune is usually played live on the pitch for the first half, while a modern version of the tune is played over the PA system for the second half. The club also play a modern version of their anthem "When You're Smiling" before kick-off on home matchdays, with the connection to the song dating back to the late 1970s. Foxes Never Quit is the club's motto, with these words placed above the tunnel inside the stadium.

Previous manufacturers have included Bukta (1972–76, 1990–92), Admiral (1976–79, 1983–88), Umbro (1979–83), Scoreline (1988–90), Fox Leisure (1992–2000), Le Coq Sportif (1999–2005), JJB (2005–07), Jako (2007–09), Joma (2009–10), Burrda (2010–12) and Puma (2012–18).
The club's current main shirt sponsor is BC.GAME. The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of Ind Coope in 1983. British snack food manufacturer Walkers Crisps are the club's official snack partner. Walkers Crisps have held a long association with the club, sponsoring their shirts from 1987 to 2001 and the stadium from 2002 to 2011. Other sponsors have included John Bull (1986–87), LG (2001–03), Alliance & Leicester (2003–07), Topps Tiles (2007–09), Loros (2009–10), King Power (2010–21, 2023–24), Tourism Authority of Thailand (2020–21) and FBS (2021–23). Siam Commercial Bank became the club's first sleeve sponsor, and the deal was valid for the 2017–18 season. Since the 2018–19 season, the sleeve sponsor has been Bia Saigon.

Stadium and training ground
In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League. When first starting out, they played on a field by Fosse Road, hence the original club name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of land by Filbert Street and moved there in 1891.
Some improvements by noted football architect Archibald Leitch occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two-tier stand was built, nicknamed "the Double Decker", which would persist until the ground's closure in 2002. With the exception of the addition of compulsory seating, the ground saw no further development until 1993, when the Main Stand was demolished and replaced by the new Carling Stand. The addition of the new stand, while the rest of the ground had been untouched since the 1920s, led manager Martin O'Neill to joke that he used to "lead new signings out backwards" so they only saw the Carling Stand.

The club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002, to a new 32,500-capacity all-seater stadium located less than 300 yards away. The address of the current site, Filbert Way, retains a link with the club's former home ground. The first match hosted at the stadium was a 1–1 draw against Athletic Bilbao, Bilbao's Tiko scored the first goal at the stadium and Jordan Stewart became the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford.
The stadium was known as the Walkers Stadium until 2011 in a sponsorship deal with Leicester-based food manufacturers Walkers. On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium King Power Stadium, and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 5 July 2011, it was announced that the Walkers Stadium would now be known as King Power Stadium.
The stadium currently has a capacity of 32,259, with plans formally approved in December 2023 to extend this to 40,000. In 2020, the club moved into a new state-of-the-art training complex in the Leicestershire village of Seagrave, described as being "one of the world's most advanced training facilities." The club's former training ground Belvoir Drive now serves as the training ground for Leicester City Women.

Rivalries, support and hooliganism
The club's main rivals are Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Coventry City. Lesser rivalries also exist with Chelsea, dating back to around 1980, and more recently with Tottenham Hotspur, as both teams battled to win the 2015–16 Premier League. Leicester were widely considered to be Nottingham Forest's main rivals prior to the mid-1970s. However, when Brian Clough was appointed as Forest manager in 1975, much to the dismay of Derby fans, the rivalry between Forest and Derby quickly intensified. The Leicester-Forest rivalry is however, still prominent on the border of both cities, and on the border of both counties (Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire).
The origin of the club's anthem "When You're Smiling", sung by supporters at home and away matches, dates back to the late 1970s with a modern version of the tune currently played before kick-off on home matchdays. Like many other clubs in English football, Leicester have had links to hooliganism. In August 2000, Leicester were listed as the 2nd most violent football club in England and Wales. Between 2019 and 2023, they averaged the 5th highest number of hooligans at matches. During the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons, the club were ranked 3rd and 4th respectively for football banning orders. In March 2025, a report revealed that in the past five seasons, Leicester were ranked within the top 15 clubs in the country for arrests.

Managerial history
Leicester City's current manager is Martí Cifuentes, who was appointed on 15 July 2025. 
Nigel Pearson and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge of the club. Dave Bassett also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent coach. Up until Peter Hodge was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection, and tactics. Though Hodge was originally also titled "secretary/manager" he has retrospectively been named as the club's first official "manager."

Records and statistics
Graham Cross holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 600 games between 1960 and 1976, increased from 599 following the club's decision to incorporate the 1971 Charity Shield into official records. However, Adam Black holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920 and 1935.
Striker Arthur Chandler is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 1956–57 season. The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Matty Fryatt, when he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006.
Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record by scoring in 11 consecutive Premier League games, scoring 13 in the process during the 2015–16 Premier League season. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first Leicester player since Gary Lineker in 1984–85 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester's highest Premier League scorer in a single season, ultimately finishing with 23 and the Premier League Golden Boot for the season.
The record transfer fee paid by Leicester for a player was in the region of £32-to-40 million for midfielder Youri Tielemans from AS Monaco. The highest transfer fee received for a Leicester player was approximately £80 million from Manchester United for Harry Maguire; at the time of the transfer this was the eleventh-highest-ever fee, the highest-ever move between two English teams, and the highest-ever for a defender.
Leicester's record home attendance is 47,298, for a fifth-round FA Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur at Filbert Street in 1928. The current record home attendance at the current stadium is 32,242, for a Premier League match against Sunderland on 8 August 2015. The highest-ever attendance for a non-competitive football match at King Power Stadium stands at 32,188, for a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid on 30 July 2011.
Leicester's highest ever league finish is first in the Premier League in 2015–16. The club currently holds the all-time record for second tier titles with eight.
Leicester's longest unbeaten run in league football to date was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009. The team remained unbeaten for 23 games on their way to the League One title. The club's longest run of consecutive victories in league football is currently nine, which the team achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 in the Championship.
In the 2015–16 season, Leicester achieved many new club records in what The Daily Telegraph described as "one of the most astonishing league titles of all-time". They recorded the most consecutive wins and fewest losses in any of the club's previous Premier League seasons, as well as the fewest away defeats in any previous top-flight season. The record for consecutive victories came against five clubs including Watford, Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Sunderland. Coincidentally, Leicester kept a record of five straight clean sheets against each of the same five opponents. The King Power Stadium's home crowds in 2015–16 saw their team beaten just once in the Premier League all season.
Leicester made their UEFA Champions League debut in the 2016–17 season, their fourth appearance in European football. The club became the third English team to win on their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They also became the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition. Leicester are currently the first and only team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition. In March 2017, the club became the 50th to reach the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals.
During the start of the 2019–20 Premier League campaign, the club won 12 matches from their opening 16 fixtures, which was the most victories recorded at this stage of any previous league season.
On 25 October 2019, the Leicester team set the record for the highest margin of away victory in English top-flight history, defeating Southampton 9–0 at St Mary's Stadium. In doing so they also tied the record for the highest margin of victory in Premier League history, equalling Manchester United's 9–0 home victory over Ipswich Town in 1995. As a result, Leicester City hold the all-time top tier records for the biggest defeat, biggest away win, and highest-scoring draw.
On 8 December 2019, a 1–4 away win at Aston Villa saw the club set a new record of eight consecutive victories in the top flight. This surpassed the record of five consecutive wins during the 2015–16 Premier League title-winning campaign, and also overtook Leicester's previous all-time top flight record of seven consecutive victories achieved between December 1962 and March 1963.
On 15 May 2021, Leicester City won the FA Cup for the first time in their history, having lost four previous finals in 1949, 1961, 1963 and 1969. The club's record signing Youri Tielemans scored the winning goal against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium.
On 28 May 2023, the club was relegated from the Premier League with the highest ever squad value and player wages outside of the Premier League's traditional 'Big-Six' clubs.
In the 2023–24 EFL Championship season, the club made its best start to a league season to date, and the best in the competition's history (since becoming known as the Championship in 2004). During this campaign, the club set a new record of six straight away league wins. They also matched the all-time record of nine consecutive league wins home and away, and went four home matches without conceding for the first time since 1973.

League history
Since their election to the Football League in 1894, Leicester City have spent all but one season within the top two tiers of English football. The club's longest stint at the top level to date came between 1957 and 1969. During these years, the club reached three FA Cup finals, participated in European football for the first time, and recorded their 3rd highest ever league finish. During the 2008–09 season, Leicester played in League One, the third tier of English football, for the first time following the club's relegation from the Championship. However, the club made an instant return to the second tier and were promoted as 2008–09 League One champions.
